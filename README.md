## Deploying changes

This project uses the [middleman-gh-pages](https://github.com/edgecase/middleman-gh-pages) gem to deploy to GitHub Pages.

To deploy, ensure you're on the master branch with the latest changes and then run `rake publish`.

This will build the site, commit it to the `gh-pages` branch and push it to GitHub, updating the site.
