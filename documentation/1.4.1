<p>Colour must not be the only thing that identifies or differentiates a piece of informative content. This ensures that people who are unable to see colours, and people who have difficulty distinguishing different colours, can still tell different pieces of content apart.</p>
<h5 id="requirements">Requirements</h5>
<ul>
<li>  When rendered in monochrome, information does not disappear.</li>
<li>  Text identified by colour as having special meaning has another indicator - a visible border and label, underline or other visual effect.</li>
<li><p>Information graphics and charts that use colour as a key also provide distinctive non-colour differences - hatching patterns or directly applied labels.</p>
<h5 id="common-issues">Common issues</h5></li>
<li><p>Graphics and charts use colours without redundant patterns or size differences.</p></li>
<li><p>Colour-coding text or backgrounds to indicate essential content, pass/fail categorisation, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Links are only distinguished from plain text by colour</p>
