#### [1.4.1 Use of Colour (A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html)

Colour must not be the only thing that identifies or differentiates a piece of informative content. This ensures that people who are unable to see colours, and people who have difficulty distinguishing different colours, can still tell different pieces of content apart.

##### Requirements

*   When rendered in monochrome, information does not disappear.
*   Text identified by colour as having special meaning has another indicator - a visible border and label, underline or other visual effect.
*   Information graphics and charts that use colour as a key also provide distinctive non-colour differences - hatching patterns or directly applied labels.

    ##### Common issues

*   Graphics and charts use colours without redundant patterns or size differences.
*   Colour-coding text or backgrounds to indicate essential content, pass/fail categorisation, etc.
*   Links are only distinguished from plain text by colour

    ##### Useful resources

*   TBC
