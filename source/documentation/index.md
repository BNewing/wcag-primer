# WCAG 2.0 Getting started

This document will help you get up to speed with WCAG 2.0 quickly and avoid common mistakes people make when creating or updating web content. You will find this really helpful if you design, build or create web content. 

This information will not allow you to reach full compliance, but it will give you the essential information you need to reach a high standard. Links are provided to further content if you want to achieve a higher level of compliance.

## What is WCAG?

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) explain how to make websites accessible for disabled and older people. The guidelines are written by accessibility specialists and disabled people at the World Wide Web Consortium [W3C](https://w3.org/).

WCAG 2.0 helps make websites, documents and mobile apps accessible to people with:

* Visual impairments, including people who are blind, partially sighted, and people with conditions like being colour blind
* Hearing impairments, including Deaf people who use sign language, and people who are hard of hearing
* Mobility impairments, including people with restricted movement that stops them using a mouse or keyboard, and people wwho find it difficult to control a mouse
* Cognitive impairments, including people who are Dyslexic, on the Autistic Spectrum, and people who have learning difficulties

WCAG 2.0 also helps us think about the different ways people use the web:

* By changing the way a website looks in their browser
* By using a keyboard instead of a mouse
* By using a screen reader to present the website as speech or on an electronic Braille display
* By using a screen magnifier to increase the size of everything on-screen
* By using speech recognition to use the web with voice commands and dictation

## WCAG architecture

WCAG 2.0 has twelve guidelines, grouped into four principles. Content must be:

* Perceivable
* Operable
* Understandable
* Robust

The twelve guidelines cover areas like alternative formats, keyboard accessibility, content readability, and functionality across different devices. 

Each guideline has a number of Success Criteria (SC). Each SC has a conformance level: A, AA or AAA.

## Meeting accessibility regulations

Public sector websites, documents and mobile apps that meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA Success Criteria and publish an accessibility statement will comply with the [new accessibility regulations for public sector websites and apps](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps).

## WCAG overview

Here is a short description of the principles, guidelines and SC you must meet.

### Principle 1: Perceivable

Your service must present information in ways people can recognise and use, no matter how they consume content (by touch, sound or sight for example)
